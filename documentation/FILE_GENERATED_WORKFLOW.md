# File Generated Workflow Implementation

## Overview

The `file_generated` workflow prevents duplicate processing of refunds by tracking which refunds have already been included in generated XML files. This ensures that each refund is only processed once and provides better control over the refund generation process.

## Database Schema Changes

### New Column: `file_generated`

A new boolean column `file_generated` has been added to the `refunds` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE refunds ADD COLUMN file_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**Column Properties:**
- **Type**: `BOOLEAN`
- **Default**: `FALSE` (new refunds are not processed by default)
- **Purpose**: Tracks whether a refund has been included in a generated XML file

## Implementation Details

### 1. Generate Refund Data Function Changes

**File**: [`supabase/functions/generate-refund-data/index.ts`](../supabase/functions/generate-refund-data/index.ts)

#### Interface Updates
```typescript
interface RefundRecord {
  id: number;
  created_at: string;
  "first name": string;
  "last name": string;
  account: string;
  email: string;
  id_card: string;
  card_balance: number | null;
  matched_card: string | null;
  amount_recharged: number;
  file_generated: boolean; // ✅ NEW FIELD
}
```

#### Database Query Changes
```typescript
// BEFORE: Retrieved all refunds
const { data: refundsData, error: refundsError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('refunds')
  .select(`
    id,
    created_at,
    "first name",
    "last name",
    account,
    email,
    id_card,
    card_balance,
    matched_card,
    amount_recharged
  `)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

// AFTER: Only retrieve unprocessed refunds
const { data: refundsData, error: refundsError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('refunds')
  .select(`
    id,
    created_at,
    "first name",
    "last name",
    account,
    email,
    id_card,
    card_balance,
    matched_card,
    amount_recharged,
    file_generated
  `)
  .eq('file_generated', false) // ✅ FILTER UNPROCESSED ONLY
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

#### Key Benefits
- **Prevents Duplicate Processing**: Only returns refunds that haven't been processed
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces data volume by filtering out processed records
- **Better Control**: Allows selective reprocessing by resetting `file_generated` to `false`

### 2. Process Refunds Function Changes

**File**: [`supabase/functions/process-refunds/index.ts`](../supabase/functions/process-refunds/index.ts)

#### Post-Processing Update Logic
```typescript
// After successful XML generation, mark refunds as processed
console.log(`[${requestId}] ===== UPDATING FILE_GENERATED STATUS =====`);
const refundIds = refundsToProcess.map(refund => refund.id);
console.log(`[${requestId}] Marking ${refundIds.length} refunds as processed: ${refundIds.join(', ')}`);

try {
  const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
    supabaseUrl,
    supabaseServiceKey,
    { auth: { persistSession: false } }
  );

  const { error: updateError } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('refunds')
    .update({ file_generated: true }) // ✅ MARK AS PROCESSED
    .in('id', refundIds);

  if (updateError) {
    console.error(`[${requestId}] Failed to update file_generated status:`, updateError);
    // Log error but don't fail the entire process since XML was generated successfully
    console.warn(`[${requestId}] WARNING: XML was generated successfully but failed to mark refunds as processed.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`[${requestId}] Successfully marked ${refundIds.length} refunds as processed (file_generated = true)`);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`[${requestId}] Error updating file_generated status:`, error);
  console.warn(`[${requestId}] WARNING: XML was generated successfully but failed to mark refunds as processed.`);
}
```

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Non-Blocking**: Update failures don't prevent XML file generation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All update attempts are logged for audit purposes
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even if status update fails
- **Manual Recovery**: Administrators can manually update status if needed

## Workflow Process

### 1. Initial State
```sql
-- New refunds have file_generated = false
INSERT INTO refunds (...) VALUES (..., false);
```

### 2. Data Retrieval
```typescript
// generate-refund-data only returns unprocessed refunds
GET /functions/v1/generate-refund-data
// Returns: refunds WHERE file_generated = false
```

### 3. XML Generation
```typescript
// process-refunds generates XML and updates status
POST /functions/v1/process-refunds
// 1. Generates XML file
// 2. Updates: file_generated = true for processed refunds
```

### 4. Subsequent Calls
```typescript
// Future calls exclude already processed refunds
GET /functions/v1/generate-refund-data
// Returns: only new/unprocessed refunds
```

## Usage Examples

### Normal Processing Flow

```javascript
// Step 1: Check available refunds
const dataResponse = await fetch('/functions/v1/generate-refund-data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' }
});
const data = await dataResponse.json();
console.log(`${data.data.summary.valid_refunds} refunds available`);

// Step 2: Process refunds
const processResponse = await fetch('/functions/v1/process-refunds', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    debtor_config: { /* config */ },
    processing_options: { max_refunds: 50 }
  })
});
// XML file generated, refunds marked as processed

// Step 3: Subsequent check
const nextDataResponse = await fetch('/functions/v1/generate-refund-data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' }
});
const nextData = await nextDataResponse.json();
console.log(`${nextData.data.summary.valid_refunds} refunds remaining`);
// Should be fewer refunds (processed ones excluded)
```

### Reprocessing Specific Refunds

```sql
-- Reset specific refunds for reprocessing
UPDATE refunds 
SET file_generated = false 
WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);

-- Or reset all refunds (use with caution)
UPDATE refunds SET file_generated = false;
```

### Checking Processing Status

```sql
-- Count processed vs unprocessed refunds
SELECT 
  file_generated,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(amount_recharged) as total_amount
FROM refunds 
GROUP BY file_generated;

-- Results:
-- file_generated | count | total_amount
-- false          | 25    | 1250.00
-- true           | 82    | 4100.00
```

## Testing

### Test Script

A comprehensive test script is available: [`scripts/test-file-generated-workflow.js`](../scripts/test-file-generated-workflow.js)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Initial data retrieval (unprocessed refunds only)
- ✅ XML generation and status update
- ✅ Subsequent data retrieval (fewer refunds)
- ✅ Edge cases (no refunds available)
- ✅ Error handling scenarios

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Update configuration in the script first
node scripts/test-file-generated-workflow.js
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Check Initial State**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM refunds WHERE file_generated = false;
   ```

2. **Call Generate Refund Data**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-refund-data" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
   ```

3. **Process Refunds (Dry Run)**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-refunds" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"debtor_config":{"name":"Test","iban":"BE68539007547034","country":"BE"},"processing_options":{"dry_run":true}}'
   ```

4. **Process Refunds (Actual)**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-refunds" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"debtor_config":{"name":"Test","iban":"BE68539007547034","country":"BE"},"processing_options":{"max_refunds":5}}'
   ```

5. **Verify Status Update**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM refunds WHERE file_generated = true;
   ```

## Benefits

### 1. Prevents Duplicate Processing
- **Problem Solved**: Refunds were being processed multiple times
- **Solution**: Track processing status with `file_generated` flag
- **Result**: Each refund processed exactly once

### 2. Improved Performance
- **Before**: Retrieved all refunds from database
- **After**: Only retrieves unprocessed refunds
- **Impact**: Faster queries, reduced memory usage

### 3. Better Control
- **Selective Processing**: Can limit number of refunds per batch
- **Reprocessing**: Can reset status for specific refunds if needed
- **Audit Trail**: Clear record of what has been processed

### 4. Data Integrity
- **Consistent State**: Database always reflects current processing status
- **Recovery**: Can recover from failures by checking status
- **Monitoring**: Easy to monitor processing progress

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Database Queries for Monitoring

```sql
-- Processing status overview
SELECT 
  file_generated,
  COUNT(*) as refund_count,
  SUM(amount_recharged) as total_amount,
  MIN(created_at) as oldest_refund,
  MAX(created_at) as newest_refund
FROM refunds 
GROUP BY file_generated;

-- Recent processing activity
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_refunds,
  SUM(CASE WHEN file_generated THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as processed,
  SUM(CASE WHEN NOT file_generated THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as pending
FROM refunds 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Identify stuck refunds (old but not processed)
SELECT id, created_at, "first name", "last name", amount_recharged
FROM refunds 
WHERE file_generated = false 
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

### Maintenance Tasks

1. **Regular Status Checks**
   - Monitor processing rates
   - Identify stuck refunds
   - Verify data consistency

2. **Cleanup Operations**
   ```sql
   -- Reset failed processing attempts (if needed)
   UPDATE refunds 
   SET file_generated = false 
   WHERE file_generated = true 
     AND id NOT IN (
       SELECT refund_id FROM processed_xml_files 
       WHERE status = 'completed'
     );
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   ```sql
   -- Add index for better query performance
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_refunds_file_generated 
   ON refunds(file_generated, created_at);
   ```

## Error Scenarios and Recovery

### 1. Status Update Failure
**Scenario**: XML generated successfully but status update fails
**Detection**: Check logs for "WARNING: XML was generated successfully but failed to mark refunds as processed"
**Recovery**: 
```sql
-- Manually update status for specific XML file
UPDATE refunds 
SET file_generated = true 
WHERE id IN (/* list of processed refund IDs */);
```

### 2. Partial Processing
**Scenario**: Some refunds processed, others failed
**Detection**: Compare XML transaction count with database updates
**Recovery**: Process remaining refunds or reset failed ones

### 3. Database Inconsistency
**Scenario**: Status doesn't match actual processing state
**Detection**: Audit queries show mismatches
**Recovery**: 
```sql
-- Reset all to reprocess (use with extreme caution)
UPDATE refunds SET file_generated = false;

-- Or reset specific date range
UPDATE refunds 
SET file_generated = false 
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31';
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control
- Only admin users can process refunds
- Status updates require service role permissions
- Audit logging for all status changes

### 2. Data Integrity
- Atomic operations where possible
- Comprehensive error logging
- Recovery procedures documented

### 3. Monitoring
- Track all processing attempts
- Alert on unusual patterns
- Regular consistency checks

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Batch Processing Metadata
```sql
-- Track which batch each refund was processed in
ALTER TABLE refunds ADD COLUMN batch_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE refunds ADD COLUMN processed_at TIMESTAMP;
```

### 2. Processing History
```sql
-- Create audit table for processing history
CREATE TABLE refund_processing_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  refund_id INTEGER REFERENCES refunds(id),
  batch_id UUID,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  xml_message_id TEXT,
  status TEXT
);
```

### 3. Retry Mechanism
- Automatic retry for failed status updates
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Dead letter queue for persistent failures
