k6 run --out json=results/card-results.json card-recharges.js
k6 run --out json=results/nfc-results.json nfc-operations.js
k6 run --out json=results/mixed-results.json mixed-operations.js

# Clean up test data after load testing
k6 run cleanup-test-data.js
```

#### Load Test Scenarios

The load testing suite includes the following scenarios:

1. **Bar Operations** (`bar-operations.js`): Simulates bartenders processing orders
2. **Card Recharges** (`card-recharges.js`): Simulates the recharge flow for prepaid cards
3. **NFC Operations** (`nfc-operations.js`): Tests NFC card scanning performance
4. **Mixed Operations** (`mixed-operations.js`): Simulates real-world mixed workloads

Each test scenario includes progressive load patterns:
- **Low Load**: Gradual ramp-up to a small number of concurrent users
- **Medium Load**: Moderate traffic simulation
- **High Load**: Heavy traffic to test system boundaries
- **Extreme Load**: Stress testing to identify breaking points

#### Key Load Testing Features

- **Rate Limit Handling**: All tests include exponential backoff retry logic for API rate limits
- **Realistic Patterns**: Simulates realistic user behavior with weighted distributions
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks response times, success rates, and error patterns
- **Test Data Cleanup**: Utilities to clean up test data after load testing
- **Custom Metrics**: Custom K6 metrics for detailed performance analysis

## 📝 Testing Rate Limit Handling

The application includes comprehensive rate limit handling with exponential backoff for all API operations. This ensures that the application can gracefully handle rate limits imposed by the Supabase API.

### Implementation of rate limit tests

The application properly handles rate limit errors (HTTP 429) with exponential backoff retry logic. Our tests verify that:

1. When rate limit errors occur, the application retries the operation with increasing delays
2. After successful retry, the operation completes as expected
3. If maximum retries are exceeded, the application shows an appropriate error message

Here's how we've implemented reliable testing for rate limits:

```typescript
// Example test for handling rate limit errors with exponential backoff
it('should handle rate limit errors with exponential backoff', async () => {
  // Mock the API function to simulate rate limit errors
  let callCount = 0;
  vi.mocked(apiFunction).mockImplementation(async () => {
    callCount++;
    if (callCount <= 2) {
      // Fail with rate limit for first 2 calls
      return Promise.reject({ status: 429, message: 'Too many requests' });
    } else {
      // Succeed on third call
      return Promise.resolve({ success: true });
    }
  });

  // Perform the operation that will trigger the API call
  await performOperation();

  // Verify first call was made
  expect(apiFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

  // Advance timer to trigger first retry
  await vi.advanceTimersByTime(1100); // Just past 1000ms backoff

  // Verify second call was made
  expect(apiFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);

  // Advance timer to trigger second retry
  await vi.advanceTimersByTime(2100); // Just past 2000ms backoff

  // Verify third call was made and succeeded
  expect(apiFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);
  
  // Verify success message or state
  expect(successIndicator).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### Key testing techniques

1. **Fake timers**: Use `vi.useFakeTimers()` to control time advancement in tests
2. **Controlled API mocks**: Implement mocks that return different responses based on call count
3. **Timer advancement**: Use `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` to trigger retry logic
4. **Assertion at each step**: Verify the correct behavior after each timer advancement

### Areas with rate limit handling

The following operations include rate limit handling with exponential backoff:

- **Bar payment processing**: When creating bar orders during high traffic
- **Card topup operations**: When recharging cards from the admin interface
- **Stripe webhook handling**: When processing Stripe events
- **Product operations**: When creating or updating multiple products

- **URL configuration**: Verify success/cancel URLs are accessible

#### For `stripe-webhook`:
- **Webhook signature**: Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is correctly configured
- **Duplicate events**: Stripe may send duplicate webhooks - function handles this
- **Metadata validation**: Ensure session includes required metadata
- **Database connectivity**: Webhook requires database access for balance updates

### 📊 Monitoring and Debugging

#### Monitor Session Creation:
```sql
-- Check recent checkout session creations
SELECT 
    request_id,
    status,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM idempotency_keys 
WHERE source_function = 'create-stripe-checkout' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Monitor Payment Processing:
```sql
-- Check recent Stripe recharges
SELECT 
    card_id,
    amount_involved,
    transaction_type,
    created_at
FROM app_transaction_log 
WHERE transaction_type = 'stripe_recharge' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

#### If checkout sessions fail to create:
1. Check card exists in `table_cards`
2. Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is configured
3. Check amount is within valid range (0.01-1000 EUR)
4. Ensure `client_request_id` is unique

#### If webhooks fail to process:
1. Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe dashboard
2. Check webhook signature in logs
3. Ensure session metadata includes `card_id` and `amount`
4. Verify database connectivity and stored procedure availability

This architecture ensures **secure, reliable, and atomic** payment processing with comprehensive error handling and monitoring capabilities.
